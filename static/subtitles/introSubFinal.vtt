00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.380
Welcome to the Algorithmic Justice Tribunal. Today,
you serve as member of the investigative committees.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:10.820
Your role is to scrutinize the
accountability of automated systems

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.000
and conduct a fact-finding inquiry
into the unlawful foundation

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.261
and exploitative purpose of the iBorderCtrl 
project—an EU-funded initiative

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:25.478
testing experimental surveillance technologies
at the Union’s external borders.

00:00:25.478 --> 00:00:30.178
The subject of this interrogation is 
the Artificial Border Guard of iBorderCtrl

00:00:30.178 --> 00:00:35.698
an AI system designed to conduct lie detection
and other assessments

00:00:35.698 --> 00:00:39.795
to fully automate the classification
of individuals based on their

00:00:39.798 --> 00:00:45.488
perceived threat potential. iBorderCtrl operates
within a broader EU research

00:00:45.488 --> 00:00:51.698
framework known as Horizon. The testing of high-risk
surveillance and AI technologies

00:00:51.688 --> 00:00:56.388
on migrants and refugees raises significant
ethical concerns.

00:00:56.388 --> 00:01:04.331
Yet, even the latest EU AI Act guidelines,
published on February 2, 2025,

00:01:04.341 --> 00:01:09.507
fail to adequately address these issues,
leaving dangerous gaps in regulation.

00:01:09.507 --> 00:01:15.881
The absence of clear regulations does not mean
the absence of harm—only the absence of accountability.

00:01:15.871 --> 00:01:19.481
As member of the investigative committees,
you now have the opportunity

00:01:19.491 --> 00:01:24.491
to direct five questions
to the summoned entity.
